# ussd
A simple ussd application used to allow the exchange of information between authorities and local communities and how they can protect their livestock and crops while coexisting together with wildlife.

The application involves the use of Africa's Talking which is a Kenya-based mobile solutions firm integrating reliable two-way SMS, voice, and USSD functionality across mobile providers in Africa. The application will involve the usage of the online USSD emulator offered for free by Africa's Talking. The project involved writing the USSD application's interface using PHP. The aim of the project was to provide a way in which people from rural areas and do not have access to the internet or have smartphones can gain access to information that can help them protect their livestock and crops without also harming the animals.

Documentation regarding the usage of Africa's Talking can be found in their website. http://https://africastalking.com/
